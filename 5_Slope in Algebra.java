The provided statement is accurate and offers a creative way of explaining the concept of slope in algebra. Let me break down the key points:

1. **"Average rate of change is also called slope":** This is correct. In algebra, the slope of a line represents the average rate of change between two points on that line.

2. **"It is a straight line, drawn between two points":** The slope is indeed associated with straight lines, and it measures the steepness of the line.

3. **"To calculate it, what you do next is take the change in y, divide by change in x":** This is a concise way of expressing the formula for calculating slope. The slope (m) is calculated as the change in y divided by the change in x, often represented as (Δy/Δx).

4. **"The change in y is also called rise, because it’s vertical":** True. The change in y represents the vertical movement between two points, and it's often referred to as the "rise."

5. **"The change in x, though, is often called run":** Accurate. The change in x represents the horizontal movement between two points and is commonly referred to as the "run."

6. **"So average rate of change is rise over run":** This succinctly summarizes the formula for calculating the average rate of change or slope: \(\text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}}\).

The use of a creative song to explain the concept of slope, rise, and run adds a fun and memorable dimension to learning algebra. It's a great way to reinforce these concepts and make them more accessible to students.
