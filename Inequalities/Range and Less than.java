-1 < x  < 3, what does this mean in algrba and inequalities, does it mean x is between -1 and 3 or does it mean x is less tha1 and less than 3

----------------------------------------------------------
The inequality \(-1 < x < 3\) means that \(x\) is a real number that is greater than -1 and less than 3. So, your interpretation "x is between -1 and 3" is correct.

To break it down:

- \(x > -1\): This indicates that \(x\) is greater than -1.
- \(x < 3\): This indicates that \(x\) is less than 3.

Putting them together with the "and" condition (represented by the symbol \(<\)), you get that \(x\) is greater than -1 AND less than 3. So, \(x\) falls within the interval \((-1, 3)\), 
excluding the endpoints.











like -1 < x  < 3,  and -1 < x, do this mean x is greate than one in both or when doe s < mean greater
--------------------------------------------------------
Lets break down the two inequalities you've provided:

1. \(-1 < x < 3\): This means that \(x\) is a real number greater than -1 and less than 3. So, \(x\) falls within the open interval \((-1, 3)\), excluding the endpoints.

2. \(-1 < x\): This means that \(x\) is a real number greater than -1. It does not place any upper limit on \(x\), so \(x\) can be any number greater than -1.

In both cases, the symbol \(<\) means "less than." In the context of inequalities:

- \(a < b\) means that \(a\) is less than \(b\).
- \(a > b\) means that \(a\) is greater than \(b\).

So, in the second inequality, \(-1 < x\), it means \(x\) is greater than -1.

To summarize:
- \(-1 < x < 3\) means \(x\) is between -1 and 3, excluding the endpoints.
- \(-1 < x\) means \(x\) is greater than -1.
