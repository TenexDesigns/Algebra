Perfect squares are numbers that can be expressed as the square of an integer. They have rational square roots. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give a particular number. Prime factors are finite for any given number but can be infinite in the general sense when considering all possible numbers.

Let's use the methods discussed to simplify the square roots of 48 and 543.

### Simplifying the Square Root of 48:

1. **Factorization Method:**
   \[ \sqrt{48} = \sqrt{16 \times 3} = \sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{3} = 4 \sqrt{3} \]

2. **Prime Factorization Method:**
   \[ \sqrt{48} = \sqrt{2^4 \times 3} = \sqrt{2^2 \times 2^2 \times 3} = 4 \sqrt{3} \]

So, both methods give us the simplified form \(4 \sqrt{3}\).

### Simplifying the Square Root of 543:

1. **Factorization Method:**
   - You can find perfect square factors, but in this case, 543 doesn't have any perfect square factor. So, the factorization method doesn't simplify it further.

2. **Prime Factorization Method:**
   \[ \sqrt{543} = \sqrt{3 \times 181} = \sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{181} \]

   - The prime factorization of 543 involves the prime number 181, and since 181 is prime, we cannot simplify it further using this method.

In both cases, the simplification involves finding perfect square factors or prime factors that can be extracted from the square root. The prime factorization method helps when dealing with numbers that don't have obvious perfect square factors.

Note: Prime factors are finite for any specific number, but the set of all prime numbers is infinite. The methods discussed here are applied to specific numbers, so we are dealing with finite sets of prime factors for those particular numbers.
