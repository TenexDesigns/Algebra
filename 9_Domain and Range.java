The text you provided accurately describes the concepts of domain and range in algebra. Let's break down the key points:

### Domain and Range:

1. **Definition:**
   - **Domain:** The set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.
   - **Range:** The set of all possible output values (y-values) corresponding to the input values in the domain.

2. **Application:**
   - Domain and range are fundamental concepts in algebra and are used to describe the input and output behavior of functions. They are crucial for understanding the scope and limitations of a function.

### Explanation of the Text:

1. **"When you look at a function, you see x and you see y!":** This emphasizes the two variables, x and y, which are typically associated with a function.

2. **"Domain is all the x values, and range is all the ys":** Correct. The domain consists of all possible x-values, and the range consists of all possible y-values.

3. **"Only values that exist should be in its sight!":** This highlights that the domain and range should only include values that make the function well-defined.

4. **"Functions like x squared and cubed have infinite domain and range":** True. Quadratic and cubic functions often have domains and ranges that span all real numbers.

5. **"Exclude undefined x or y values from the domain or range":** This is an important rule. If there are values of x or y for which the function is undefined, they should be excluded from the domain or range, respectively.

6. **"Functions like the square root of x can't have negative x":** Correct. The square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system.

7. **"Some complex functions never reach a certain y":** This refers to situations where certain y-values may not be attainable due to the nature of the function.

### Conclusion:

The text provides a concise and accurate overview of domain and range in the context of algebra. Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing and interpreting the behavior of functions in various mathematical applications.

  Certainly! Let's go through a couple of examples to illustrate the concepts of domain and range.

### Example 1:

Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \).

**Domain:** All real numbers are allowed as inputs, so the domain is \( \mathbb{R} \) (all real numbers).

**Range:** The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) can produce all non-negative values. The range is the set of all non-negative real numbers, denoted as \( [0, \infty) \).

### Example 2:

Let \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \).

**Domain:** The square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system. Therefore, the domain of \( g(x) \) is all non-negative real numbers, denoted as \( [0, \infty) \).

**Range:** The output of \( g(x) \) is always non-negative, so the range is also \( [0, \infty) \).

### Example 3:

Consider the function \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x} \).

**Domain:** The denominator cannot be zero, so the domain excludes \( x = 0 \). The domain is \( \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \) (all real numbers except zero).

**Range:** As \( x \) approaches zero from the positive side, \( h(x) \) approaches positive infinity, and as \( x \) approaches zero from the negative side, \( h(x) \) approaches negative infinity. Therefore, the range is \( (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) \).

These examples illustrate how to determine the domain and range of functions and emphasize the importance of considering restrictions based on the nature of the functions.
