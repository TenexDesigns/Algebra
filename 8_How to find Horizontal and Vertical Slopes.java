The statements you provided are correct and describe the concepts of horizontal and vertical slopes in algebra. Let's break down the key points:

### Slope of Horizontal and Vertical Lines:

1. **Horizontal Lines:**
   - **Slope:** Horizontal lines have a slope of zero.
   - **Explanation:** The change in \(y\) for any change in \(x\) on a horizontal line is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as \( m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{0}{\text{any value of }\Delta x} = 0 \).

2. **Vertical Lines:**
   - **Slope:** The slope of a vertical line is undefined.
   - **Explanation:** There is no change in \(x\) for any change in \(y\) on a vertical line. Mathematically, this is expressed as \( m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\text{any value of }\Delta y}{0} = \text{undefined} \).

### Importance and Applications:

1. **Understanding Graphs:**
   - Knowing the slopes of different lines helps in understanding the behavior of graphs. Horizontal and vertical lines have distinct characteristics that influence the overall shape of the graph.

2. **Equations of Lines:**
   - Recognizing the slope of a line is crucial when working with linear equations. The slope-intercept form of a line, \(y = mx + b\), explicitly shows the importance of slope (\(m\)).

3. **Physics and Engineering:**
   - In physics and engineering, slopes represent rates of change. For example, the slope of a distance-time graph gives the speed of an object. Understanding vertical and horizontal slopes is important in interpreting such graphs.

4. **Calculus:**
   - Slopes play a fundamental role in calculus. The derivative of a function at a point represents the slope of the tangent line at that point. The concepts of horizontal and vertical slopes extend to more advanced calculus topics.

### Verification of the Provided Statements:

1. **Horizontal Slope:**
   - "For horizontal, the change in \(y\) is zero divided by a certain change in \(x). Zero over anything is zero." This is accurate. The slope of a horizontal line is indeed zero.

2. **Vertical Slope:**
   - "In Vertical, a change in \(y\) exists, but there is no change in \(x). Anything over zero is undefined, and this applies to all vertical lines." This is also accurate. The slope of a vertical line is undefined because there is no change in \(x\).

In summary, the statements correctly explain the slopes of horizontal and vertical lines and highlight why these slopes are true. Understanding these concepts is fundamental in algebra and has broader applications in various fields.
