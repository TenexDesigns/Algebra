Quadratic functions are a specific type of polynomial function, and they represent polynomials of degree 2. In general, a quadratic function is a polynomial function of the form:

\[ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \]

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(x\) is the variable. The highest power of \(x\) in this expression is 2, making it a quadratic function.

### Characteristics of Quadratic Functions:
1. **Degree:** Quadratic functions have a degree of 2, which means the highest power of the variable (\(x\)) is 2.

2. **Graph Shape:** The graph of a quadratic function is a parabolaâ€”a symmetric U-shaped curve.

3. **Roots/Solutions:** Quadratic functions may have zero, one, or two real roots (solutions), depending on the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\)).

### Polynomials:
A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of variables, coefficients, and exponents, combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but not division by a variable. A general polynomial is expressed as:

\[ P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 \]

where \(a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_2, a_1, a_0\) are constants, \(x\) is the variable, and \(n\) is a non-negative integer representing the degree of the polynomial.

### Distinction:
- **Quadratic Function:** A specific type of polynomial function with a degree of 2. It has the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants.
  
- **Polynomial:** A more general term that includes functions of various degrees. A quadratic function is a polynomial of degree 2.

In summary, quadratic functions are a subset of polynomials, specifically those of degree 2. The term "quadratic" is often used to refer specifically to polynomials of degree 2 because of the unique characteristics associated with these functions, such as the presence of a quadratic term (\(ax^2\)) and the parabolic shape of their graphs.
