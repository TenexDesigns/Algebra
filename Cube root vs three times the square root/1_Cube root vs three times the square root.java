The cube root and three times the square root of a number are two different mathematical operations.

### Cube Root:
The cube root of a number is denoted as \(\sqrt[3]{x}\) or \(x^{1/3}\). It represents a value that, when raised to the power of 3, gives the original number. Mathematically, if \(y = \sqrt[3]{x}\), then \(y^3 = x\). For example, the cube root of 8 is 2 because \(2^3 = 8\).

### Three Times the Square Root:
Three times the square root of a number \(x\) is expressed as \(3 \sqrt{x}\). It represents three times the square root of \(x\), where the square root of a number is denoted as \(\sqrt{x}\). Mathematically, if \(y = 3 \sqrt{x}\), then \(y = 3 \times \sqrt{x}\). For example, if \(x = 9\), then \(3 \sqrt{9} = 3 \times 3 = 9\).

### Differentiating the Two:
The key difference lies in the operations and the powers involved:

- The cube root involves finding a number that, when raised to the power of 3, gives the original number.
- Three times the square root involves taking the square root of a number and then multiplying it by 3.

For example:
- Cube root of 8: \(\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\)
- Three times the square root of 8: \(3 \sqrt{8} = 3 \times \sqrt{8} \approx 10.77\)

These operations are different, and the results will generally be different for most numbers. It's important to understand the specific operation being performed based on the given expression.
