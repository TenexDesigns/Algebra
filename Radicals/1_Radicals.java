The term "radical" in mathematics generally refers to the symbol √, which represents the square root. However, it's important to note that the concept of a radical extends beyond just square roots. The radical symbol can represent any root, not just the square root.

### Square Root (n = 2):
- The square root is a specific case of a radical. For example, √9 means finding the number that, when squared, equals 9. In this case, the square root is 3 because \(3^2 = 9\).
  
### General Radicals (n ≠ 2):
- A radical with an index other than 2 is referred to as an nth root. The general form is \(\sqrt[n]{x}\), where \(n\) is the index and \(x\) is the radicand.

- For example, \(\sqrt[3]{8}\) means finding the number that, when cubed, equals 8. In this case, the cube root is 2 because \(2^3 = 8\).

### Connection:
- The square root can be seen as a special case of the nth root, where the index \(n\) is 2. So, \(\sqrt{x}\) is the same as \(\sqrt[2]{x}\), and both represent finding the number whose square is \(x\).

- More generally, \(\sqrt[n]{x}\) represents finding the number whose nth power is \(x\).

### Multiplication:
- When you mention "multiplying the square root with \(n\)," it's crucial to clarify the context. If you mean multiplying the square root by \(n\), it would typically be written as \(n \times \sqrt{x}\). If you mean taking the nth root, it would be \(\sqrt[n]{x}\).

In summary, while the radical symbol (√) is commonly associated with the square root, it is a general notation that can represent any root, denoted as \(\sqrt[n]{x}\). The concept extends beyond just square roots to nth roots, depending on the value of \(n\).
