The statement "if the ys for an x is more than one, you do not have a function" is not accurate, and it might be a misunderstanding or a miscommunication. Let me clarify the concept of a function in algebra.

In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs (often denoted as x) and a set of possible outputs (often denoted as y), with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. In other words, for every x in the domain of the function, there is only one corresponding y value.

If for a given x, there are multiple y values, it would violate the definition of a function. Such a relation is not a function and is called a "many-to-one" or "not a function" relation.

For example:
- \(y = x^2\) is a function because for each x, there is only one corresponding y value.
- \(y^2 = x\) is not a function because for certain x values, there are two possible y values (positive and negative square roots).

In summary, the correct statement would be: "If for any x there are more than one corresponding y values, the relation is not a function." This concept is fundamental in algebra and is used to determine whether a given relation can be considered a function or not.
