The text you provided offers a concise explanation of how to find the domain and range of a continuous function. Let's break down the key points:

### Steps to Find Domain and Range:

1. **Look at X and Y Values:**
   - Examine the x and y values of the function.

2. **Identify Endpoints of the Domain:**
   - The leftmost and rightmost points on the graph are the endpoints of the domain. These represent the minimum and maximum x-values.

3. **Identify Endpoints of the Range:**
   - The highest and lowest points on the graph are the endpoints of the range. These represent the maximum and minimum y-values.

4. **Use X Values for Domain and Y Values for Range:**
   - Make sure to use x values for the domain and y values for the range.

### Verification:

1. **Domain:**
   - "The leftmost and rightmost points on the graph are the endpoints of the domain." This is correct. The domain of a function is determined by the range of x-values for which the function is defined.

2. **Range:**
   - "The highest and lowest points on the graph are the endpoints of the range." This is also correct. The range of a function is determined by the range of y-values it takes on.

### Recommendations:

1. **Consider Graphical Tools:**
   - Using a graphing tool or software can visually aid in identifying the leftmost, rightmost, highest, and lowest points on the graph.

2. **Understand the Function's Behavior:**
   - Understanding the behavior of the function, such as asymptotes, limits, and critical points, can provide additional insights into the domain and range.

3. **Check for Special Cases:**
   - Be aware of special cases where the function may have jumps, holes, or asymptotic behavior, as these can impact the domain and range.

In summary, the steps provided offer a straightforward approach to finding the domain and range of a continuous function by examining the leftmost, rightmost, highest, and lowest points on the graph and using x values for the domain and y values for the range. It's a practical and visual method for understanding the extent of a function's input and output values.
