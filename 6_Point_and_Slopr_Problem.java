To sketch a line given a point and a slope, you can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:

\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the given point, and \(m\) is the slope.

In this case, the given point is \((4, 1)\), and the slope is \(2/1\).

So, substituting these values into the point-slope form:

\[ y - 1 = \frac{2}{1}(x - 4) \]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[ y - 1 = 2(x - 4) \]

Distribute the 2 on the right side:

\[ y - 1 = 2x - 8 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ y = 2x - 7 \]

Now you have the equation of the line. You can use this equation to sketch the line on a coordinate plane. Alternatively, you can use the slope and the given point to plot additional points and connect them to create the line.

Here's how you can plot a few points and sketch the line:

1. Use the given point \((4, 1)\).
2. Use the slope \(2/1\) to find another point. For example, move 1 unit to the right and 2 units up from the given point to get another point \((5, 3)\).
3. Connect the two points to sketch the line.

Your line should pass through both points \((4, 1)\) and \((5, 3)\), representing the equation \(y = 2x - 7\).
